# How to draw a logo on RibbonControl


Our WinForms [Ribbon](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraBars.Ribbon.RibbonControl) now has an [EmptyAreaImageOptions](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraBars.Ribbon.RibbonControl.EmptyAreaImageOptions) property, which allows you to display an image within a free Ribbon region without interfering with custom draw events.

Use the [ImageAlignment](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraBars.Ribbon.RibbonEmptyAreaImageOptions.ImageAlignment), [ImagePadding](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraBars.Ribbon.RibbonEmptyAreaImageOptions.ImagePadding), and [SizeMode](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraBars.Ribbon.RibbonEmptyAreaImageOptions.SizeMode) properties to align your image inside empty area bounds.
